# GIT Simplified and Explained
**GIT** is a system that tracks changes to our project files over time. It can record project changes and go back to a specific version of the tracked files, at any given point in time.  This system can be used by many people to efficiently work together and **collaborate on team projects**, where each developer can have their own version of the project, distributed on their computer. Later on, these individual versions of the project can be merged and adapted into the main version of the project.
